# 🚀 Custom AI LLM RAG + MCP | Multi-Modal (Text + Vision) Intelligent Retrieval System

Craft powerful, scalable AI applications using cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) with custom-tailored pipelines designed for your domain.

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside

### 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Build smart assistants that combine LLMs with real-time knowledge retrieval from:
- PDFs, websites, internal wikis
- Vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate)
- Structured data sources (SQL, APIs)

### 🧩 Multi-Component Pipelines (MCP)
Modular AI pipelines that connect:
- Embedding engines (OpenAI, HuggingFace, Ollama)
- Local/hosted LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, GPT-J, etc.)
- Memory, context injection, and streaming chat UIs
- Scalable backends (FastAPI, LangChain, Haystack)

### 🎯 Fine-Tuning Open-Source Models
Train or fine-tune open models with your domain-specific data:
- Legal, medical, finance, customer support, etc.
- Format support: JSON, CSV, markdown, chat logs, text files
- Tools: LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT, SFT on local or cloud GPUs

---

## 💼 Use Cases
- Internal knowledgebase chatbots
- Autonomous research and report generators
- Enterprise copilots for finance/legal
- Smart search interfaces with LLM reasoning

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python, FastAPI, LangChain, Haystack
- Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate
